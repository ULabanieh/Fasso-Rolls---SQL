# ðŸŒ¯ Project Overview
---
Fassos is an online food ordering company that specializes in rolls, meaning that a variety of rolls such chicken rolls, egg rolls and veggie rolls get delivered to your doorstep. In this project, we dive into metrics and insights about this company that involve Data Exploration, Data Cleaning and Data Analysis processes. The dataset includes customer orders, IDs, driver data, product types (different types of rolls) and sales data. The project is divided into 3 sections: 

- **Dataset Creation:** setup of the dataset and input of the data using the "CREATE TABLE" and "INSERT INTO" commands. The different tables included in the dataset are the following:

- **Roll and Order Metrics:** insights about the products and sales, such as what roll types are preferred and orders by hour of the day 

- **Driver and Customer Experience:** insights about delivery efficiency and driver performance

The dataset is comprised of 6 tables:
- **driver_order:** shows the order, which driver was assigned to it, pickup time, distance travelled and duration of the journey
- **driver:** list of driver IDs and their registration date
- **rolls:** the types of rolls available
- **ingredients:** the types of ingredients that can be included in the rolls
- **roll_recipes:** the list of ingredient IDs each roll is made of
- **customer_orders:** list of orders from customers with info such as which roll was ordered, if they want to exlcude an ingredient or add an extra ingredient and the order date.

# Dataset Creation
---
The dataset was created manually within SQL as it contains fictional data for the purpose of the project only. I create all the 6 tables and insert the relevant data into them using the `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT INTO`commands. Also specified data types. Let's have a look at the query to create the main table we will be querying, customer_orders:

```SQL
drop table if exists customer_orders;
CREATE TABLE customer_orders(order_id integer,customer_id integer,roll_id integer,not_include_items VARCHAR(4),extra_items_included VARCHAR(4),order_date datetime);

INSERT INTO customer_orders(order_id,customer_id,roll_id,not_include_items,extra_items_included,order_date)
values (1,101,1,'','','01-01-2021  18:05:02'),
(2,101,1,'','','01-01-2021 19:00:52'),
(3,102,1,'','','01-02-2021 23:51:23'),
(3,102,2,'','NaN','01-02-2021 23:51:23'),
(4,103,1,'4','','01-04-2021 13:23:46'),
(4,103,1,'4','','01-04-2021 13:23:46'),
(4,103,2,'4','','01-04-2021 13:23:46'),
(5,104,1,null,'1','01-08-2021 21:00:29'),
(6,101,2,null,null,'01-08-2021 21:03:13'),
(7,105,2,null,'1','01-08-2021 21:20:29'),
(8,102,1,null,null,'01-09-2021 23:54:33'),
(9,103,1,'4','1,5','01-10-2021 11:22:59'),
(10,104,1,null,null,'01-11-2021 18:34:49'),
(10,104,1,'2,6','1,4','01-11-2021 18:34:49');
```

# Roll and Order Metrics
---
Here we will start looking at interesting metrics about rolls and orders. We will go from simple queries to more advanced ones. I will showcase here the most important queries. To view all the queries in full detail, download the project files and explore them at will. 

#### How many rolls were ordered?
---

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(roll_id) AS number_rolls
FROM customer_orders;
```

Output:

#### How many unique customer orders were made?
---

```SQL
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT customer_id) AS count_customer_orders
FROM customer_orders;
```

---

```SQL
SELECT driver_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS count_successful_orders
FROM driver_order
WHERE cancellation not in ('Cancellation', 'Customer Cancellation')
GROUP BY driver_id;
```

Output:

#### How many of each type of roll was delivered?
---
```SQL
SELECT roll_id, COUNT(roll_id) AS number_delievered
FROM customer_orders
WHERE order_id in(
	SELECT order_id
	FROM (SELECT *,
		CASE WHEN cancellation in ('Cancellation', 'Customer Cancellation')
